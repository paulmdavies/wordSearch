# wordSearch

## Gameplay
### Accepted Words

The word list is obtained from [this](https://github.com/marcoagpinto/aoo-mozilla-en-dict/tree/master/en_GB%20(Marco%20Pinto)) repository.

A downloaded version is used, rather than a direct link, as the file name changes regularly.

The file is pre-filtered to save space using the following command:

```grep "^[a-z]*$" wordlist.txt > filtered_wordlist.txt```
